Love or hate, we meet spring, so I guess we need to know how it works.

I K 5/13/2021 5:51 PM
do you have an opinion on other microservices frameworks vs spring? e.g. https://blogs.itemis.com/en/4-microservice-frameworks-in-comparsion-example-included

I K 5/13/2021 5:52 PM
thanks!

I K 5/13/2021 5:52 PM
of course, but i have never seen anyone use other frameworks, if they already use spring

C K 5/13/2021 5:53 PM
New to J ava world ,any reference how can I get more knowledge on beans, ?

if we add dependancy on classpath then spring automatically creates bean for all deps calsses?

R S 5/13/2021 6:11 PM
Can we change the embedded server - use jetty instead of tomcat?

A B 5/13/2021 6:12 PM
what if I use WAR instead of JAR?

S S 5/13/2021 6:13 PM
haha

C J 5/13/2021 6:13 PM
Say it again!

C J 5/13/2021 6:13 PM

N V 5/13/2021 6:14 PM
is it limited to only tomcat webserver?

a a 5/13/2021 6:15 PM
what advantage we have when we deployed in Tomcat server vs the embedded one?

A T 5/13/2021 6:15 PM

Spring Assistant

G L 5/13/2021 6:17 PM
I've been stuck before in running apps due to a maven error during compile which I have not been able to resolve. Is this common?

V R 5/13/2021 6:18 PM
Is the spring parent always needed ? Can i skip it and still make the code work ?

I K 5/13/2021 6:20 PM
i have never worked on a project using gradle - maven everywhere so far, but i understand gradle is a lot more advanced for serious production builds - is that the reason you prefer it?

P J 5/13/2021 6:20 PM
what does 1.0.11.Realese actually mean?

P J 5/13/2021 6:21 PM
Oh okay, t hank you!!

R D 5/13/2021 6:23 PM
can i still use myeclipse ide for this exercise?

S P 5/13/2021 6:24 PM
Yeah You can down load Spring Tool Suite

S P 5/13/2021 6:24 PM
It is based on Eclipse and I have used that it's quite good I must say

V T 5/13/2021 6:25 PM
what shortcut you are using to bring-up the documentation?

L H 5/13/2021 6:26 PM
@v t, good question. Ken, could you share that shortcut, please.

a a 5/13/2021 6:26 PM
How can we configure for https and HTTP

a a 5/13/2021 6:26 PM
?

C G 5/13/2021 6:26 PM
@PathVariable is equivalent with @RequestParam

S S 5/13/2021 6:27 PM
ctrl Q on windows

a a 5/13/2021 6:27 PM
I mean using the encription keys

R S 5/13/2021 6:27 PM
What is Model used for?

L H 5/13/2021 6:27 PM
@S S, thanks

L H 5/13/2021 6:28 PM
Could you compare model use versus 'fast attributes' versus session variables?

L H 5/13/2021 6:30 PM
Not the question. I was asking for a comparison

L H 5/13/2021 6:30 PM
That helps. Thanks.

R S 5/13/2021 6:31 PM
Ken, will you be uploading this code snippet with comments to the github?

A P 5/13/2021 6:31 PM
What if the page location/name is different

K W 5/13/2021 6:31 PM
Does the view has to be HTML?

R S 5/13/2021 6:32 PM
I understand - need to take notes now :-)

L H 5/13/2021 6:34 PM
FWIW, I used the wrong term, it should have been 'Flash Attribute' (https://www.baeldung.com/spring-web-flash-attributes). Was curious about how often those are used in industry or actual practice. Thanks.

P J 5/13/2021 6:35 PM
How long it takes to release the port 8080 after the application is stopped?

Derek H 5/13/2021 6:35 PM
Break time - class will resume shortly.

S H 5/13/2021 7:02 PM
so autowired instances are unique to all classes?

A S 5/13/2021 7:04 PM
then - we use qua lifier annotation ?

S S 5/13/2021 7:13 PM
thank you very much!

R S 5/13/2021 7:13 PM
how do we make this Greeting bean into Spring Bean? In other words what's the difference?

R S 5/13/2021 7:14 PM
Thanks!

K R 5/13/2021 7:15 PM
How will the control come from main class to the Greetings Controller

K R 5/13/2021 7:17 PM
Thanks for the explanation, it helps!

P J 5/13/2021 7:19 PM
When it is serialized to JSON do need to de-serialize it?

Y G 5/13/2021 7:20 PM
If return a list of object, how to handle by response?

A S 5/13/2021 7:20 PM
why do we need default status code?

a T 5/13/2021 7:20 PM
how can we handle multiple Response Status based on conditions or error

A S 5/13/2021 7:22 PM
try http :8080/hello on terminal - what do we get?

P V 5/13/2021 7:24 PM
which is the utility which gived this formatted response in the command line

S S 5/13/2021 7:25 PM
https://httpie.io/

R S 5/13/2021 7:25 PM
is the response body text sent as readable text string on the wire?

R S 5/13/2021 7:26 PM
how can we encode that so that it's not readable?

R S 5/13/2021 7:27 PM
ok

R S 5/13/2021 7:27 PM
thanks

A S 5/13/2021 7:28 PM
We obviously dont use random ports on main service, right ? :)

C G 5/13/2021 7:31 PM
then how to write unit tests for RestController without starting server? or this is a way to write unit tests

C G 5/13/2021 7:31 PM
thanks

R S 5/13/2021 7:31 PM
MockMvc

P G 5/13/2021 7:35 PM
seems its Logging Aspect, you are using the Aspect concept of spring to intercept logging

Derek H 5/13/2021 7:36 PM
Break time - class will resume shortly.

P V 5/13/2021 7:36 PM
is there any difference in Starting the Application using gradlew bootRun vs Running it from Executing the Class which is annotated with @SpringBootApplication

Kenneth K 5/13/2021 7:37 PM
Both of those approaches do the same thing, as you said, but the bootRun is from the Gradle plugin

Kenneth K 5/13/2021 7:37 PM
That's easier to run from outside the IDE, for example

P V 5/13/2021 7:39 PM
ok - thank you

Derek H 5/13/2021 7:45 PM
Break has concluded. Class will now continue.

@Derek: Is there way to playback the recorded video at different speed ?

Derek H 5/13/2021 7:56 PM
No, but you can skip around if needed.

s n 5/13/2021 7:56 PM
how do you get to the documentation. There's a lot of stuff on spring.io

A J 5/13/2021 7:57 PM
aspect can be used for auditing purposes

s n 5/13/2021 7:57 PM
thanks

P G 5/13/2021 7:57 PM
yes

T F 5/13/2021 7:58 PM
This is java not AspectJ?

L H 5/13/2021 8:00 PM
@V J, in another live training, another attendee recommended 'video playback controller' plugin for Chrome. (I haven't tried it yet, so your call whether to try it out.)

P V 5/13/2021 8:02 PM
by default this hooks are on the public methods of the class

I K 5/13/2021 8:04 PM
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-spring-aop-and-aspectj-aop - could you address spring aop vs aspectj ?

S H 5/13/2021 8:06 PM
but we have stopped using this type of config?

S H 5/13/2021 8:06 PM
XML and java config was replaced by annotations?

A P 5/13/2021 8:07 PM
is it like constants file ?

A S 5/13/2021 8:11 PM
Can we instantiate beans by passing dynamic parameters?

S H 5/13/2021 8:13 PM
is build.gradle similar to pom.xml for maven? while opening projects?

V R 5/13/2021 8:14 PM
can someone ping the git url of the samples.. if u dont mind

S B 5/13/2021 8:16 PM
Can @Resource be used instead of @Autowired?

S H 5/13/2021 8:19 PM
what is the difference between spring and reactive spring?

S H 5/13/2021 8:19 PM
what exactly is Mono?

D K 5/13/2021 8:20 PM
Can we use smallRye Mutiny?

P V 5/13/2021 8:22 PM
Any Spring Managed Class - Construtor with Arguments - without decorating with @AutoWired on the Constructor - will it pull the Spring Bean which is Constructor Argument?

S J 5/13/2021 8:22 PM
what if we don't give a time to wait inside block()?

S H 5/13/2021 8:23 PM
but then we have to compulsorily block a mono? then how is it async?

S H 5/13/2021 8:24 PM
I think block() can be without parameters

R S 5/13/2021 8:30 PM
Thanks, Ken for an interesting session!

S S 5/13/2021 8:31 PM
