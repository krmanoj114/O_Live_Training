A D
katacoda exercises were good

L H
@A D, they helped reinforce the concept. Had some problems with lag

L H
Did you find interface to work well for you?

S C
I struggled with the katacoda exercises. They do not provide feedback on what you have incorrect.

L H
@Ken, I read the book beta, it was helpful, so thanks.

C J
Does the Spring Certification have kata coding tasks like this?

A D
What's the significance of PostConstruct with respect to the autowired bean injection lifecycle?

P V
This specific scenario did not proceed past step 2 for me. Neither without that GetMapping annotation nor with attempts like RequestMapping on the class level.

E J
I had to use @RequestMapping("/books") for it to work

E J
It doesn't seem to look at where in particular just that it's in the cod

S C
I gave up. Unless you have an exact match it stalls.

E J
code*

S J
I think this is because they ask for mapping at a class level

C J
Sounds like “kata coding” technology is not ready “for prime time”?

P V
katakoda in other contexts, like kubernetes scenarios etc is great

P V
My experience with the java editor was indeed sub par. In some cases it worked great and quickly but in this scenario, it made me question my understanding of the subject.

C J
Thanks PV.

I K
What about DAO vs Repository?

I K
addressed here as well: https://www.baeldung.com/java-dao-vs-repository

I K
In other words, a repository also deals with data and hides queries similar to DAO. However, it sits at a higher level, closer to the business logic of an app.

I K
Thanks!

R S
audio/video breaking up

A S
refresh - it is ok here

A S
Why did we not mention @Autowired at line 14?

A S
above line 14*

A D
would you use webclient or httpclient(java 11)?

D K
Is Mono an async wrapper class?

S P
is it true that from Spring Boot 3 is not mandatory to put the @Autowire in the constructor and still Spring makes the injection?

S P
ok, thanks Ken

S P
I didn't know about the constructors "rule"

A P
Hi, where would it find the referece to the WebClient.Builder

A P
and id could not find for WebClient

A S
screen share ?

D K
Cant see your screen

J L
You are not sharing your screen, Ken.

S P
I can't see your screen Ken

S P
share your screen

S P
thank you

A P
thank you

I K
You just like us to look at you, Ken

S P
thanks

R S
streams looks good

S P
there should be the WebClient

A S
How did Spring know which App context to use?

Derek H
Break time - class will resume shortly.

Kenneth K
All my changes have been pushed to GitHub

S B
Hi, Ken. I have heard the term "DTO" a lot? Could you please explain what it is? And how is it different from DAO?

R S
Ken, have your changes been committed?

Kenneth K
Sure. I'll mention it when we resume, because it is relevant to database stuff

Derek H
Break has concluded. Class will now continue.

A D
also could you talk a little about java 11 httpclient?

I K
use Ken Kousen once - see what joke we get for you

A M
hahahahahaha

B S
lol

R S
Ha Ha

C J
Lol. Best joke on NY

A P
Sorry, where is the joke coming from. I thought we are exposing a url and maintaining a database of jokes. Are we getting from a site

A M
Yes indeed.

A P
ok .. Got it .. we are reading the response from the site

A P
Thank you

A D
after adding the dependency, did spring pick it up from the classpath?

J L
Given that you're not really interested in all of those 147 beans - is there a way of opting out of that eager creation?

A D
thanks. does that imply RestTemplateBuilder is annotated with @Component?

M K
What's Mono?

A P
Is there a way to run the application apart from running from IDE and access the endpoints

I K
think of all the classes in the jdk we're not using

S J
In the JokeServiceTest class, do we need to autowire the jokeservice in the 2nd test as we are already doing field injection?

I K
of course, they're not loaded in memory

I K
@Bean is another component

I K
so, with Java configuration, you have much more granular control over the beans that get created, right?

R S
yes - rupee symbol

I K
what is that in dollars?

I K
is that a lot of rupees?

I K
we have a lot of friends from I ndia here

N K
Shift + F6

R S
@IK - i believe it is

I K
168,974.91 United States Dollar

I K
yes

I K
:)

I K
feel free to ignore me :)

M K
Can we autowire beans inside other beans?

I K
as a matter of fact, you can ONLY autowire beans inside other beans - Spring does not manage any other classes, which are not beans

M K
Is this thread-safe by default or do we need to ensure this ourselves?

R S
sorry, i missed your explanation on @prototype because i lost the audio

R S
So the assertion would fail?

R S
thanks

A P
Awesome.. thank you

R S
mvn clean install

I K
mvn package

I K
install puts it in your local repo

C G
I don't understand the exact use of AOP? where to use it?

R S
Ken, please check your git repo on the web, because it does not show any commits this morning

Derek H
Break time - class will resume shortly.

B S
Amazing, now that makes a lot of sense AOP drives the proxies

C J
Just found out https://learning.oreilly.com/attend/java-9-to-17-the-new-feature-benefits/0636920057909/0636920057908/ Henry Tremblay

I K
good overview of AspectJ: https://www.baeldung.com/aspectj

I K
sorry - wrong link

Kenneth K
All changes have been pushed to the GitHub repository

I K
https://www.baeldung.com/aspectj

C J
Of course a good prerequisite course to Java Champion Henry Tremblay’s course would be https://learning.oreilly.com/attend/whats-new-in-java/0636920219491/0636920053891 from the inimitable Ken Kousen.

Derek H
Break has concluded. Class will now continue.

S B
Are all the spring generated and user-defined beans in the application context thread safe?

R S
Ken the repo shows changes now. Thanks

A P
yes.. able to pull the changes ..thanks

Kenneth K
https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot

P M
but with the webClient you can set the Headers and more. Is it possible with the RestTemplate?

P M
Ok thanks I started late in the course

I K
pure jdbc brings nostalgic feeling of java being very young

A M
Agree.

S C
JDBC - I still do it :-(

A M
Painfull memories

R S
Agr

R S
Agree with @AM

A P
How about queries taking more than 1 parameter like "select first, second from student where id =? and age < ?

I K
rowNum is not used in the example, but it could be useful

P V
Would rowNum be used to figure out how many rows an update sql statement actually updated?

I K
maybe if i wanted to process only odd rows, for example

P V
nvm, just noticed we are only talking about SELECTs

I K
>>@PV Would rowNum be used to figure out how many rows an update sql statement actually updated? -I don't think so, it is always the number of the row currently processes

I K
processed

M K
Is this by default set to auto-commit?

M K
thanks

S P
is it possible to make blocking queries? I mean that while some thread/instance reads a table the others have to wait in order to get the result they are looking for?

I K
jdbc.properties can be anywhere on the classpath?

I K
and all properties are in application.properties

A D
is application.yml used more now?

I K
great trick! thanks, Ken

A D
thanks :)

P M
is it possible to encrypt the DB-Password. The way they show it in the documentation is not secured!!!

M K
Is there a way to obfuscate sensitive information like password?

P V
is it possible to segregate the Properties files based on the environment and woould spring be able topick the properties files based on the environment

N K
How to configure multiple Data sources? Let's say one each of types MySQL and PostgreSQL or simply 2 different MySQL

R S
Ken can you please post the link to the spring reference here?

Kenneth K
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/

R S
thanks!

M K
Love the progress bar :)

I K
3. HSQLDB (HyperSQL Database) HSQLDB is an open source project, also written in Java, representing a relational database. It follows the SQL and JDBC standards and supports SQL features such as stored procedures and triggers.

I K
It can be used in the in-memory mode, or it can be configured to use disk storage.

P M
your entities are not in the entities package

I K
if you get a moment, could you share you app design process for a new app? I mean, after you set up a Spring Boot starter app, do you follow a particular design order - controllers, repos, etc?

K E
why we create 3 constructors?

I K
thank you - i did not mean 'right now', but before the end of the course. Thanks, Ken!

K E
ty!

I K
PRIVATE BENJAMIN. s

I K
Private Benjamin is an officer by now. You mentioned her once before

Derek H
Break time - class will resume shortly.

Kenneth K
Is she, though? I suspect she left the service after her enlistment was up

A D
are schema.sql and data.sql are looked up by spring using the file names?

A D
in other words, if we name them schema1.sql and data1.sql, will they be picked up?

Kenneth K
Those names (schema.sql and data.sql) are specific, though you can set the names you're actually using in application.properties

A D
got it, thanks

A D
it seems that we need to know some conventions established by spring to make life easier :)

Kenneth K
Right, but that's why you're here :)

A D
yeah :)

Derek H
Break has concluded. Class will now continue.

P M
can I put the sqls in a different Folder e.g. /dbscripts for example?

A D
what happens if we've two or more db drivers in the classpath?

A D
sure, thanks

I K
however, there is such an option as XA transactions, i believe

I K
good to know, thanks!

P M
Ken could you fix your Mic? The sound is not so clear as before. Many Thanks

P M
I did the refresh

J L
Sound is a bit worse indeed.

P M
Many thanks!

G L
refresh needed

P M
perfekt!

J L
Better now. Thanks.

M L
Way better, thanks

A M
Better.

G L
good

P O
better

B A
Yes..better

N W
Much better audio

J U
But in this case you have two shots against the database.

B S
Ken, The Exception sounds more like it will fail if it finds more than one row?

T S
Why not query for a List<Office> instead? When it is null or empty, return nothing. But it saves one query

T S
you'd still fitler by id though

P M
how about Option.orElse?

P M
Optional.orElse()

P M
the null?

P M
then null

P M
then return null

A P
Can i use JdbcTemplate.update(insertSQL )

A P
instead of simpleJdbcInsert

A P
How are the 2 different

A M
Sorry for the silly question but English is not my mother tongue. What's the correct pronunciation, "S Q L" or "SEQUEL"?

P M
wich values will be the Enum have in the DB?

A M
hahahahahaha

A M
Ok, thanks.

I K
The standard says that 'Ess-cue-ell' is the appropriate way of speaking SQL. However, many English-speaking database professionals still use the nonstandard pronunciation "sequel."

P M
many thanks!

A M
Thanks I K

I K
@AM of course

P M
@Transaction may be to rescue?

I K
What about @DirtiesContext ?

I K
oh, right!

N W
The officer's name is familiar 😉

P M
whats the difference with Strategy Auto
