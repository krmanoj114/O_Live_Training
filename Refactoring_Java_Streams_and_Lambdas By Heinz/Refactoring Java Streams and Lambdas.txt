Good morning from Silicon Valley

Shannon C
Hello everyone and welcome! The class has begun and you should be able to hear and see Heinz now in the media player.

K L
Good morning and evening from Kuala Lumpur

C J
I don’t see slides in the repo I just cloned

The recording of class will be available within 48 hours, here: https://learning.oreilly.com/attend/refactoring-to-java-streams-and-lambdas/0636920507567/0636920057189/

Hellow from Bentonville

Search RefactoringToStreams-2.0.pdf on the root folder itself

H .
Can't agree more, for the recording. I was wondering if these files could be played on another player, or the player supported better seek options.

Shannon C
Unfortunately no, the recordings are only available on the O'Reilly platform, which is currently using ON24 for the capture of live events. Thank you

Whats the difference between Migrate 1 and 2?

K S
how to add inspection profile in analyzer?

K S
got it

M G
Are these options avaialable on community edition ?

C J
One instructor says dont waste time with JPMS modules unless you are writing a library to be used by others. Is this a good idea?

C J
It was Ken

C J
kousen

E N
Java 9 also introduced JShell

C J
Nice answer. Thanks.

C J
if it goes on Maven Central use JPMS.

C J
Did the Java bytecode change with each version of Java? Or are all these new features just abstractions on the original byte code spec?

A S
What is the purpose of the limitation on running compile code on the preview version non compatible ascendant withe earlier versions ?

I K
invokedynamic?

J S
Invoke Dynamic

A S
OK, Thanks.

C J
You use Release Candidate of IntelliJ for a live class. Other teachers I have never seen do that. The JetBrains RCs are very stable I guess?

M G
I'm not able access github link posted above

M G
is there a way to, may be mail the code zip

K K
For some reason my InteliJ cannot find the link to AuthHelper#loadAuthenticators_internal. Where should I search for the file in the directory structure?

D V
may be due to VPN issue cannot connect

K K
YEs, shift-shift worked, thanks!

M G
It worked, Thank you

A S
Afer a single refectory done, how to make sure that nothing have been broken ?

E N
Should we run any unit tests to verify our refactoring code changes do not actually break anything in the project ?

A Y
Can't search for RefactoringTasks class

S W
can you please remove the black screen

C J
Wow, just found your first article https://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive was Nov. 2000 AD!

C J
Did you say https://www.oracle.com/erp/what-is-erp/ ?

M G
which one is preferred, Lambda or method references ?

Heinz K
https://ofbiz.apache.org/

I K
There are rare cases where method references don't work and you need to provide a lambda

I K
But I don't have an example on top of my head

E N
Speaking of interfaces, Java 15 introduced local interfaces. What can they be used for ? What are good use cases for them ?

M G
I'm not so good at method references, if you have a training wheels for that

C S
Yes, I can't even get the first exercise. I think I need another example.

S W
can you explain {@link EntityDataLoadContainer#init(List, String, String)} // Why doesn't command:: work

C J
Please move timer off screen.

I K
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37413106/java-lang-nullpointerexception-is-thrown-using-a-method-reference-but-not-a-lamb

M G
which one is more readable method reference or lambda ?

C S
Thanks - that makes more sense. I had forgotten the cast.

A C
Do I have to config IntelliJ to get "refactoring to lambda/method reference" to show up on Alt/Enter?

A Y
Is there a string difference between ClassName::method and instanceReference::method. Should we not use the latter for runtime polymorphism to kick in?

A Y
strong difference*

C J
Can you please make your project files window small and your code window bigger to minimize left and write code scrolling?

M G
I know it's silly question, mistakes in method reference will cause compilation errors right not runtime exceptions

C J
Thank you, much better

E N
Can we use method references in cases when a lambda expression takes two or more input parameters ?

I K
There are bound and unbound instance method references. Ca n you tell the difference and maybe provide an example of the unbound ones?

C J
On24 is the WORST for so many things!

A C
where can I find all these "Java * Migrate" Profiles to import into Intellij.

M G
when should we use forEach and when should we use stream ?

A Y
Apart from the readability, is there any performance reason that we decided to use lambdas and streams? I mean we were working fine with for- loops and and anonymous inner classes

M G
in fact i've heard there's a performance drop with lambdas

E N
Speaking of streams, I heard it is not recommended to create local variables of Stream type. Is it true or not ?

C J
As a Java beginner I find lambdas and streams much easier to read and understand

J A
Lucky U, CJ :)

J A
totally agree with you Heinz, we old people like to know details of each and everything

A Y
We should not change local variables(outside lambda) inside the lambda function , is that right?

M G
bug report intellij

I K
Unless you pass the boxed Integer type

A Y
So does removeIf marks the elements to be removed and then shift all the elements later on, right?

C J
Video stopped?

K L
Stopped.

C J
Refreshed.

A Y
Video does not work

A 4
We cant hear you

B C
No sound

Shannon C
stand by everyone

K K
Yes, not we can hear!

B C
Yes we can here you

A 4
refresh , video is awful

C J
Text is SO blurry. After several refresh.

S W
+1

A Y
Sorry, but do we have another alternative to On24, something like zoom. It takes a lot of patience on on24 :)

S W
lol - now you are repeating in a loop

C J
On24 is ALWAYS the WORST of several providers. No wonder they are hiring engineers in Silicon Valley.

C J
Total blurry video.

C J
Only audio and with frozen video.

C J
audio is crystal clear.

Shannon C
Please give us a little bit of time--working on it. We'll get there. Thanks!

Shannon C
We'll resume shortly. Heinz is switching connections.

K L
i can see it clear now

S W
looks good to me

C J
Seems fine now.

Shannon C
Thank you for your patience everyone

K K
Now I can see your IntellJ better than mine :)

C J
Looks fine now.

C J
All OReilly on24 instructors should switch to the lower screen resolution on the Mac. This is the first time in 100+ On24 streams that the font is instantly clear. Normally it is blurry for 5 seconds.

C J
You are the only instructor I have seen switch off of higher res 1080p down to a much lower macOS screen res and now all of the blurry buffering of text code sharing has gone away completely. I have a 200mbps Comcast ISP and the text is always blurry @ 1st

C J
BTW, slides are ALWAYS perfectly clear. No buffering or blurry.

C J
Of course, the on24 recording is perfectly clear. No blurriness ever. Only while streaming.

E N
Is there any significant difference between unmodifiable maps returned from Map.of() methods and unmodifiable views of specified maps returned from Collections.unmodifiableMap() method ?
