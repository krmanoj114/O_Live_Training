Hi LV: Ok, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you on VPN by chance? Sometimes that can interrupt the connection to ON24.

Shannon C
If refreshing, changing browsers, or using Chrome Incognito doesn't fix things, I recommend connecting from your phone or a tablet, if possible. Or, rebooting your machine and then joining. (A connection from your phone may be quicker)
